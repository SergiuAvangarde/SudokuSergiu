This app was made for FullHD Resolution (1920x1080), it is not tested for other resolutions

This is a simple sudoku generator and solver program.
You can randomly generate a combination of numbers for the sudoku table
Then you can save the table to a .csv file and use the Solver to find a solution for it
Any sudoku table might have more than one solution because the program leaves only 17 random numbers on the array

## Features

-Random generate a resolved sudoku table, then it removes the numbers in random order until only 17 are left

-rezolve any sudoku table almost instantly

-it is using a backtracking algorithm to find the first corect solution for the table to generate and to solve the table

-you can save any number of tables to the .csv file

-you can select the loaded tables from the dropdown menu on the solver

## Usage
You can randomly generate a variated number of sudoku tables and try to come up with a solution, 
you can use the solver to find out if your solution is corect or to get a hint of what you need to do

## Roadmap
Future improvements to the program include:

-an updated UI

-more code optimizations

-optimize the generation algorithm

-adding the functionality to input your own sudoku table

-add the function to try to resolve the table for yourself
